CBHC (Coldboot Haxchi) changes your default system title to make your SysNAND launch the DS virtual console game by default instead of the home menu, which will then load RedNAND.
{: .notice}

This page is optional. Regular Haxchi works just fine as is; this just offers extra convenience and removes the risk of you accidentally breaking your SysNAND.
{: .notice--info}

**You MUST have a functional Haxchi setup for this to work. If you do not, you will BRICK!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Your Haxchi DS virtual console game MUST be on the internal memory of your Wii U. If it is on a USB drive, you will BRICK!**
{: .notice--danger}

**Your Haxchi DS virtual console game MUST be a LEGITIMATE copy or you will BRICK!**
